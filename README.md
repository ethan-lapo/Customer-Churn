This project predicts how likely a customer will churn. This is an extensive project that starts with manipulating and cleaning the data. Then I dive into exploratory data analysis to get an idea of the distributions and how the variables are related to one another.
Next I used heirarchical clustering to group numeric features and see how the clusters compared to customer churn. Lastly, I fitted multiple models and used the top three to predict customer churn given an input grid. Cross validating these models allowed me to visualize the 95% Confidence Interval for each model's average accuracy.
